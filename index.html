	<p class="lead">Applied Kinetic Theory Workshop for Junior Researchers at Wisconsin</p>
	<p>We will hold a workshop at the University of Wisconsin - Madison, April 19-21, 2018. The goal of this conference is to bring young, energetic researchers working in kinetic theory and kinetic applications together to exchange ideas and facilitate collaborations. The focus is mainly on the mathematical analysis, computation of kinetic theory in various kinds of physical sciences, such as neutron transport, radiation, plasma physics, fluid mechanics and medical imaging.
		This is organized by <a href="http://www.math.wisc.edu/~qinli/">Qin Li</a> and <a href="https://kitcnewton.github.io">Kit Newton</a>.
		 This workshop is possible thanks to the support of National Science Foundation and the UW Math Department.</p>
