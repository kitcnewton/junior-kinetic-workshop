<h3>Commitment to Inclusivity</h3>

<p>The organizers are committed to making <i>M2@UW</i> an event inclusive and supportive of all. In particular, we endorse and are guided by the Department of Mathematics' <a href="https://www.math.wisc.edu/climate"
>Statement of Shared Community Values</a>:
</p>

<p>
<i>
"As a diverse group, the Mathematics Department strives to foster an open and supportive community in which to conduct research, to teach, and to learn. In accordance with these beliefs and ยง 36.12 of the Wisconsin Statutes, the Mathematics Department affirms that all community members are to be treated with dignity and respect and that discrimination and harassment will not be tolerated. We further commit ourselves to making the department a supportive, inclusive, and safe environment for all students, faculty, staff, and visitors, regardless of race, religion, national origin, sexual orientation, gender identity, disability, age, parental status, or any other aspect of identity. 
<br>
 <br>
To all members of our community, we, the members of the Department of Mathematics, welcome you.
 <br>
 <br>
If you see room for improvement in an aspect of climate or diversity within the Mathematics Department, please contact Gloria Mari-Beffa (Department Chair) or Betsy Stovall (Math Department Climate Committee)."
