	<p>Title: Direct solution to the space-time dependent Peierls-Boltzmann transport equation using an
eigendecomposition method
<br> Co-authors: Austin Minnich, Lucas Lindsay
<br>Abstract: Nonlocal thermal transport is generally described by the Peierls-Boltzmann transport
equation (PBE). However, solving the PBE for a general space-time dependent problem remains
a challenging task due to the high dimensionality of the integro-differential equation. In this
work, we present a direct solution to the space-time dependent PBE with a linearized collision
matrix using an eigendecomposition method. Furthermore, we show that there exists a
generalized Fourier type relation that links heat flux to the local temperature, and this
constitutive relation is valid from ballistic to diffusive regimes. Combining this approach with ab
initio calculations of phonon properties, we demonstrate that the derived solution gives a more
accurate description of thermal transport in crystals that exhibit weak anharmonicity than the
commonly-used single-mode relaxation time approximation and thus will lead to an improved
understanding of phonon transport in solids.

	<p>Title: A Comparison of Galerkin and First Order System Least Squares Finite Element Formulations of Electron Magnetohydrodynamics
	<br>
	Abstract: In multi-timescale extended magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) simulation, representing Hall term effects is particularly challenging. When substituted into Faraday's Law, the Hall term introduces an advection-like term, which hampers mathematical coercivity in Galerkin finite-element methods. The first order system least squares (FOSLS) approach can be used to make the system coercive and stabilize the advection-like term in implicit computations [1]. To better understand this numerical challenge, we consider a limit of the extended MHD system known as electron MHD (EMHD), which largely isolates the Hall term. In EMHD the FOSLS approach presents many choices for independent variable pairs. Here we study two options, vector fields {B, J} in the function space {H1, H1} and {B, E} in {H1, H(curl)}. We also consider two Galerkin formulations with B in H1 and H(curl). These formulations are being implemented using the MFEM library. Numerical properties of all four formulations are compared and contrasted. The multiscale nature of the EMHD tearing mode in a slab geometry provides a challenging test case that exposes strengths and weaknesses of the different formulations and that permits validation with analytical theory.

	<p>Title: High-Order Low-Order Nonlinear Convergence Accelerator for the Rosenbluth-Fokker-Planck Collision Operator and Applications to Multiscale Problems in Inertial Confinement Fusion (ICF)
	<br>
	Abstract: In weakly coupled plasmas, the integro-differential Fokker-Planck collision operator describes the dynamical collisional relaxation of the plasma distribution function in the velocity space. The operator is quadratically nonlinear, features exact conservation of mass, momentum, and energy, satisfies the Boltzmann H-theorem, preserves positivity of the distribution function, and features a unique equilibrium solution (i.e., a drifting Maxwellian). Additionally, the collisional velocity space transport coefficients are obtained from integrals of the distribution function (the so-called Rosenbluth potentials). The integral formulation, together with the above-mentioned properties make the numerical solution aspects of this system exceedingly challenging to deal with.
	<br>Often, collision times, τcol, are much shorter than dynamical timescales of interest (e.g., in ICF problems, often >104), and the use of implicit methods (i.e., Newton, accelerated Picard [1], etc.) is warranted. Fully implicit methods are advocated here, owing for the need to exactly preserve conservation laws, and to ensure asymptotic convergence to the Maxwellian when appropriate [2]. However, fully implicit methods demand nonlinear iterative solvers, which developing an effective one is challenging in this context owing to the non-locality of the formulation (via the Rosenbluth potentials), leading to dense linear systems.
	<br>To effectively deal with the numerical challenges arising from non-locality, we explore a multiscale iterative strategy based on high-order/low-order (HOLO) convergence accelerator scheme [3,4] for the full nonlinear Rosenbluth-Fokker-Planck collision operator. HOLO employ an LO (fluid) moment system to accelerate the convergence of the HO (kinetic) system. In turn, the LO system is closed self-consistently with the HO system. The LO system is comprised of equations for plasma number density, drift velocity, and temperature. These quantities, in turn, inform an LTE approximation for the Rosenbluth potentials plus a perturbation term [of O(Δt/τcol)<< 1] computed from the HO solution. This reformulation shifts the non-local contributions through the Rosenbluth potentials from the HO system to the LO one, which lives in a low-dimensional space and where they can be dealt with efficiently. Numerical experiments in challenging applications in ICF (i.e., shocks and implosions) will demonstrate the enabling capabilities of the HOLO scheme when Δt >> τcol.
